# ProofFrog
ProofFrog is a work-in-progress tool for verifying cryptographic game-hopping proofs. All security properties in ProofFrog are written via pairs of indistinguishable games. More info can be found on our [wiki](https://prooffrog.github.io/)

## Installation:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Commands:

To use the proof engine: `python3 -m proof_frog prove [proof_file]`. The [examples repo](https://github.com/ProofFrog/examples/]) contains a list of examples largely adapated from [The Joy of Cryptography](https://joyofcryptography.com/). See also our [examples page](https://github.com/ProofFrog/examples) on our wiki.

You can also parse any type of file (scheme, proof, game, or primitive) using `python3 -m proof_frog parse [file]`. It will read the file, transform it into an internal AST representation, stringify the representation, and print it back out to the screen.

The bash files `testParsing.sh` ensures that the ANTLR grammar can parse each file in the examples folder. `testAST.sh` parses each file with proof_frog, strips the whitespace, and diffs it with the original file to ensure that the AST output matches the file input. Finally, `testProofs.sh` runs both the suite of examples and the pytest unit tests.

## Jupyter Notebook

We have a custom kernel that allows a user to interact with proof_frog via a Jupyter notebook. To do so, run the following commands from the base directory.

```
docker build -f jupyter/Dockerfile -t proof_frog .
docker run -p 8888:8888 proof_frog
```

The output from the `docker run` command will contain a `localhost:8888` URL containing a token that will allow you to view the jupyter notebook.
